* __README-docs-ts__

* docco does not operate on ts-files ?! This seems to be a simple
configuration fix which must be investigated.

* Fir now a mirror ```*.ts.js-file``` may be provided for each ```*.ts```
so that docco will document the mirror file instead 

* The mirror is the identical file, but with a different file extension name: ```name.ts.js``` instead of ```name.ts```
